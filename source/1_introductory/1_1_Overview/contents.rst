WNPS is a cross-platform software product that predicts the wind noise
propagation paths of the holes and gaps in a vehicle and provides
guidance for the development of wind noise performance on the early
stage. Wind noise is a type of noise that is generated by air flow
around a vehicle and can affect its acoustic comfort and quality [1]_ [2]_. 
WNPS uses machine learning and data science techniques to analyze
former experimental data and conduct the prediction [3]_.

WNPS has the following features and benefits:

-  It can read the basic data of the experiment vehicle, such as vehicle
   type, height, width, length, configuration and status [4]_

-  It can output a relative ML predicted AI (Articulation Index) value
   that indicates the intelligibility of speech in noisy
   environments [5]_

-  It can print a line chart that shows how different experiment
   statuses affect the AI value [6]_

-  It can help engineers to optimize the design of vehicles for better
   wind noise performance

The intended audience of this guide are engineers who are involved in
vehicle design, testing and evaluation. This guide assumes that they
have some basic knowledge of wind noise, machine learning and data

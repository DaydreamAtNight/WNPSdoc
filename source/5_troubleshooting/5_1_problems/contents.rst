=============

Some common problems or errors that may occur while using WNPS are:

-  WNPS does not start or crashes: This may be caused by corrupted
   installation files, incompatible system settings, insufficient memory
   space etc. To fix this problem, try these solutions:

   -  Wait for another 5 mins.

   -  Quit and restart WNPS following Starting and Executing WNPS
      instructions above.

   -  Check if your computer meets minimum system requirements for
      running WNPS.

   -  Close other applications that may consume memory space before
      running WNPS.

   -  Contact technical support if problem persists.

-  Prediction process takes too long or fails: This may be caused by
   large input data size, network connection issues, server overload
   etc. To fix this problem, try these solutions:

   -  Reduce input data size by selecting fewer experiment statuses or
      removing unnecessary rows from data file.

   -  Contact technical support if problem persists.

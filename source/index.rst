Welcome to WNSP user's guide!
=============================

This is a brief user's guide of the Wind Noise Prediction Software
(WNPS). This project aimed to predict the wind noise propagation paths
of the holes & gaps and provide guidance for the development of wind
noise performance on the early stage. Machine learning and data science
techniques are adopted to analysis former experimental data and conduct
the prediction. Refer to the project developing report for all the
details.

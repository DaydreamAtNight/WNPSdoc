3.2. Tutorial 
=============

To use WNPS, you need to follow these steps:

1. Enter or select your input data using one of these methods:

   -  Manual input: Type or choose your input values from drop-down
      lists in each field under Input Data section in input panel.
      Details of input panel are explained in the `manual
      input <#manual-input>`__ section.

   -  Data file input: Click on ``Predict_from_file`` button under
      ``File`` section in the menu bar, and select your EXCEL file that
      contains your input data. The file should have one row per
      experiment status with columns corresponding to each input field.
      An example input file is shown in the `file input <#file-input>`__
      section.

2. Click on ``Predict`` button at bottom left bottom corner of input
   panel to start prediction process.

3. View your prediction results in output panel. You will see a new
   point or a line chart depending on your input data. The line chart
   shows how different experiment statuses affect the AI value. The
   relative (instead of the absolute) AI value is plotted indicates the
   AI gain/loss compared with the last status.

4. Add a new line by pressing ``new_line`` button under the ``Plotting``
   section on the menu bar then go back to step 1 to enter more data.

5. You can save your result as a data (CSV) file by clicking on
   ``save data`` button at bottom right corner of input panel. You can
   also save the line chart by clicking on the ``save_image`` button
   under ``plotting`` section on the menu bar, or clicking on the
   ``icon:save`` button on the output panel toolbar.

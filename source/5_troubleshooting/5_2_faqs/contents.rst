Some FAQs (frequently asked questions) about WNPS are:

Q: What is wind noise?

A: Wind noise is a type of noise that is generated by air flow around a
vehicle and can affect its acoustic comfort and quality .

Q: What is AI (Articulation Index)?

A: AI (Articulation Index) is a measure of speech intelligibility in
noisy environments. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate
better speech intelligibility.

Q: How does machine learning work in WNPS?

A: Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that uses
algorithms to learn from data and make predictions based on patterns. In
WNPS, machine learning algorithms are used to analyze former
experimental data and predict wind noise propagation paths based on
input variables.

Q: How accurate are prediction results from WNPS?

A: Prediction results from WNPS are based on statistical models that
have been trained and validated using former experimental data. They are
not exact measurements and may have some margin of error depending on
input data quality and quantity. They should be used as a reference or a
guidance for wind noise performance development, not as a final verdict.
